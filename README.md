# 3D Maze Game (C++ & EasyX)

A 3D perspective maze game I independently developed using C++ and the EasyX graphics library.  
This project was built after I had just learned C, and marked my first large-scale program (~1800 lines in a single file back then 😅).  
It simulates 3D scene rendering, map generation, and real-time game interaction.

## 💡 About the Project

This game was created purely based on my curiosity and love for programming. At the time, I had no idea how to split code into multiple files, and I learned many concepts (graphics rendering, logic control, state management) on the go.

Now looking back, I see this project as my first "mini engine" — a personal milestone in my programming journey.
